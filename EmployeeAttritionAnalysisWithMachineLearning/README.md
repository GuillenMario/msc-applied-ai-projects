# Employee Attrition Analysis with Machine Learning

This project explores the application of supervised machine learning techniques to predict employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset. The notebook was developed as part of the course **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** for the **Master’s in Applied Artificial Intelligence** program at Tecnológico de Monterrey.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
- **Filename**: `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv`
- The dataset includes employee-level data such as demographics, job roles, performance metrics, and whether the employee left the company.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Task

- **Type**: Supervised Learning
- **Problem**: Binary Classification
- **Target**: Employee Attrition (Yes/No)

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for preprocessing, model building, and evaluation)

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling categorical variables
   - Feature scaling and encoding

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visualizing attrition patterns

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Train/test split
   - Classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
   - Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
