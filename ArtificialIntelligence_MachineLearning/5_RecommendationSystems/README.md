# **📚 Activity: Recommendation Systems**

This activity focuses on building and evaluating **Recommendation Systems** as part of the master's program in Applied Artificial Intelligence.

## **📁 Dataset**

The dataset used contains user-item interactions, which will be used to train collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation models.

## **📊 Methodology**

The notebook follows these steps:

* **Import Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, etc.
* **Data Loading:** Read the dataset.
* **Data Processing:** Cleaning and preparation of data for recommendation models.
* **Model Training:** Application of collaborative filtering (SVD) and other recommendation techniques.
* **Evaluation:** Use metrics to evaluate model performance.
* **Visualization:** Generate plots and interpret results.

## **📃 Findings**

After evaluating the models, the notebook provides insights on the performance of recommendation systems and highlights best practices for building them.
