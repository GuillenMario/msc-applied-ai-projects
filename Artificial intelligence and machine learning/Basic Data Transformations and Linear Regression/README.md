# 🧪 Basic Data Transformation & Linear Regression

This notebook demonstrates foundational techniques in **data preprocessing**, **feature transformation**, and the application of a **linear regression model** using scikit-learn.

## 📋 Overview

The goal of this project is to prepare a basic dataset for regression modeling by:
- Exploring and visualizing the data
- Applying feature transformations (e.g., standard scaling, log transformation)
- Fitting and evaluating a linear regression model

## 📁 Contents

- `BasicDataTransformation_LinearRegression.ipynb`: Main notebook with data analysis and modeling steps.
- `README.md`: Project description and usage instructions.
- `california_housing_train.csv`: Data source.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 📈 What You'll Learn

- How to apply scaling and transformations to numerical data
- How linear regression performance can be affected by data distributions
- How to visualize and interpret regression results

📌 Notes
- This is part of coursework for an MSc in Applied Artificial Intelligence.
