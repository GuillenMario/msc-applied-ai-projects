# **📈 Time Series Forecasting**

This notebook focuses on **time series forecasting** techniques as part of the Master's in Applied Artificial Intelligence.

## **📁 Dataset**

The dataset contains temporal data used to predict future values. Specific preprocessing steps are applied to clean and prepare the series for modeling.

## **📊 Methodology**

The notebook includes the following steps:

* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the time series.
* **Naive Model:** Building a baseline model (naive forecasting) and computing the RMSE metric.
* **Visualization:** Plotting predictions vs. real data for comparison.
* **ARIMA Model:** Performing exploratory data analysis to determine appropriate p, d, q parameters and training an ARIMA model.
* **Evaluation:** Comparing model performance using RMSE and analyzing patterns such as seasonality and trends.

## **📃 Findings**

The analysis shows:
- The dataset exhibits **multiplicative seasonality** (increasing peaks and valleys over time).
- There is a clear **annual seasonal pattern**.
- ARIMA outperforms the naive baseline in terms of forecasting accuracy.
