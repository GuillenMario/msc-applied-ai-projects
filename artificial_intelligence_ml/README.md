# Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Projects  

_A collection of practical AI / ML projects from the MSc Applied AI program._  

 **Note:** This repository is still a **work in progress**. Only the **01: Basic Data Transformations & Linear Regression** notebook has been fully polished and prepared for portfolio review. The remaining modules are currently in draft/unpolished form and will be updated progressively.
