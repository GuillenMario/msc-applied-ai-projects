# ü§ñ Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Projects

_A collection of practical AI / ML projects from the MSc Applied AI program._

## üöÄ Overview

This directory showcases hands-on projects and notebooks related to **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. Each project focuses on a specific technique, dataset, and application to illustrate real-world implementation.

## üß≠ Contents

| Project/Notebook Name | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| *`Activity Learning Curves`* | This notebook explores regression models to analyze and predict outcomes from a dataset of social media advertising campaigns. |
| *`Basic Data Transformations and Linear Regression`* | This notebook demonstrates foundational techniques in data preprocessing, feature transformation, and the application of a linear regression model using scikit-learn. |
| *`Employee Attrition Analysis With Machine Learning`* | This project explores the application of supervised machine learning techniques to predict employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset. |
| *`ROC and PR Curves Analysis for Imbalanced Datasets`* | This activity focuses on the analysis of ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) and PR (Precision-Recall) curves in the context of imbalanced datasets. |
| *`Recommendation Systems`* | This activity focuses on building and evaluating Recommendation Systems as part of the master's program in Applied Artificial Intelligence. |
| *`Time Series Forecasting`* | This notebook focuses on time series forecasting techniques as part of the Master's in Applied Artificial Intelligence. |

## üìÇ How to Explore

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GuillenMario/msc-applied-ai-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the AI/ML folder:
   ```bash
   cd "Artificial intelligence and machine learning"
   ```
3. Set up your Python environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook or Lab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Execute notebooks in order, review results, and interact with plots and outputs.

## üîç Highlights

- **Recommender Systems**: Example using collaborative filtering, explained variance, and prediction evaluation.
- **Forecasting Models**: ARIMA, naive forecasting, RMSE evaluation, seasonality analysis.
- **Model Comparison**: Metrics like RMSE, plot comparisons (predicted vs. observed).
- **Best Practices**: Walk‚Äëforward validation, train/test splitting, parameter selection workflows.
